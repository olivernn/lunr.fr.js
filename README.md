# lunr.fr

This is a _very_ early implementation of a French language extension for lunr.

It includes a stemmer and a stop word list specific to French.

This requires the [i18n](https://github.com/olivernn/lunr.js/tree/i18n) branch of lunr to work, you will need to build lunr from that source. This branch will become version 0.5.0 soon.

##Â TODO

* Some tests.
* A trimmer specific to French.
* Some sanity tests from a French speaker.
